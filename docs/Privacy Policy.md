# Privacy Policy

Uhh, I suppose we don't steal your data and send it off to other businesses. The entire app is open source and is hosted by you or 
your company. 

Its also secure, like 2FA is required to enter into your account and its really nice. And the database is encrypted. 

Did I already say that the app is open source at [TempeHS/2026SE_Task1_Thribhu.K](https://github.com/TempeHS/2026SE_Task1_Thribhu.K). Like, if you don't trust the app, look at the source code yourself. We deadass don't have any telemetry.

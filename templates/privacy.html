<p>Uhh, I suppose we don&#39;t steal your data and send it off to other businesses. The entire app is open source and is hosted by you or 
your company. </p>
<p>Its also secure, like 2FA is required to enter into your account and its really nice. And the database is encrypted. </p>
<p>Did I already say that the app is open source at <a href="https://github.com/TempeHS/2026SE_Task1_Thribhu.K">TempeHS/2026SE_Task1_Thribhu.K</a>. Like, if you don&#39;t trust the app, look at the source code yourself. We deadass don&#39;t have any telemetry.</p>
